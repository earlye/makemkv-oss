# Changes

1: When a disc is inserted, makemkv automatically opens it.

2: When a rip is completed, makemkv automatically ejects the disc.

These two changes make it easier to rip in the background. Rather than
a popup upon completion, the disc pops out. You then insert the next
disc and a few seconds later it's opened in the UI. Small changes, but 
fairly important.
